## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for all required and optional variables.  
Use `VITE_EDGE_FUNCTION_NAME` when your backend edge function name differs from the default slug, `VITE_API_URL` for a custom API base, `VITE_SUPPORT_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` / `VITE_AUTH_CALLBACK_PATH` for production auth and support routing, and `VITE_ENABLE_TWO_FACTOR_AUTH=true` only after a secure backend verifier is in place.
**Never commit `.env` files.** They are in `.gitignore`.

---

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# Output: /build
# Deploy /build to your static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.)
```

Recommended: Set `VITE_APP_URL` to your production domain before building.

---

## Notification Runtime

The live frontend notification path uses the browser Notifications API together with the single service worker at `public/sw.js`.
Firebase client configuration is not part of the current web runtime.
